Configuration files for common applications. This files are used to keep configuration the same across different machines.

Files must be linked to their destinations for the applications.

For example,
`ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`

Would like to adding a mapping file for locations, but plenty of other methods available.
